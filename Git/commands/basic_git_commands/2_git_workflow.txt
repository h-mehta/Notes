Why do we need the staging area?

Let's say I have worked on some stuff, have deleted a few files,
modified a few of them and created a few of them.

All these changes need not be interlinked

So I can make logical groupings of each commit - by adding/grouping specific 
changes together, in preprartion of commiting

Thus 2 steps:
- git add (to add all the changes I want to add the logical grouping)
- git commit (to commit the logical grouping with messages & create CHECKPOINT)
