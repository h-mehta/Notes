Git commit:
-----------

We use git commit to actually commit the changes from the 
staging area to the repository

When we make a commit, we need to provide a commit message
that summarizes the changes and work snapshotted in the 
commit

Command:
-------

> git commit -m "message"

Commits all the staged changes
